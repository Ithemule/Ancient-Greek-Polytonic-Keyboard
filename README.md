[Download Link](https://github.com/Ithemule/Ancient-Greek-Polytonic-Keyboard/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)


## 2: Run
To run the keyboard, open whichever .exe file suits you best:

	With "Ancient Greek Keyboard; Accents After Letter", you will type the accents after the character. 
	
	e.g.: α + ´ = ά

	With "Ancient Greek Keyboard; Accents Before Letter", you will type the accents before the character. 
	
	e.g.: ´ + α = ά

	With "Ancient Greek Keyboard; Beta Code Version", you will type as with the Greek Beta Code. 
	
	e.g.: α + / = ά

## 3: Activate
It will start disabled, and you can activate or deactivate it at any time with Ctrl + Alt + G

>it is safe to leave running in the background, and the code can be seen in the [Source Files](https://github.com/Ithemule/Ancient-Greek-Polytonic-Keyboard/tree/main/Source%20Files) folder

>The program ([autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/)) can \*only\* be used with Windows.

## 4: Auto-Start (Optional)
If you want to set the keyboard to start with windows:
1. Press Windows+R to open the “Run” dialog box.
2. Type “shell:startup” and then hit Enter to open the “Startup” folder.
3. Create a shortcut in the “Startup” folder to any file, folder, or app's executable file. It will open on startup the next time you boot.

## 5: Editing (Optional and Difficult)
*Only* if you want to edit the keyboard, you will have to download and install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), make any edits on the .ahk file of your choice (change the appropriate .txt file to .ahk), then right-click it and click Compile Script

- To make edits, I recommend using CTRL + H to find any replace ONLY the input key you want to change, 
 - e.g. Find ` ? `, Replace with ` * `, do **not** check Match Case
   - n.b. if you set any inputs to h, you will run into difficulties typing `χ` or `φ`, 
    - if you're replacing `η`'s input, find and replace `!e`

# Features

### Combining Diacritics

There is no one button for `rough-breathing-acute-accent`.
Rather, you press the `rough-breathing` and `acute-accent` buttons to get your appropriate accent
- You can type the accents in any order, as long as they are before/after you character of choice(depending on which file you chose)
#### Example (using inputs from the tables below)

> <kbd>α</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd> + <kbd>'</kbd> will output 		`ἄ`

> <kbd>α</kbd> + <kbd>'</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd> will also output 	`ἄ`

### Native Keyboard Layout

[Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is a hotkey program, meaning it will output the keys depending on what key you input, without changing your keyboard layout.

This means that your keyboard layout will not change, only what you output
- `Γ` will always be output when you click <kbd>G</kbd>, even if you are using [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) or another keyboard layout

# Important Note
When the files are running, they delete characters by outputting `Left-Arrow` + `Delete` rather then `Backspace`
- Many characters use combining diacritics to form, such as `ᾱ́ `; 
you would have to hit `Backspace` twice to delete it, but with this workaround, you only have to press `Backspace` once

When you highlight text to delete, use `Delete` rather than `Backspace`, since `Backspace` will not work.
