## 2: Run
To run the keyboard, open whichever .exe file suits you best:

	With "Ancient Greek Keyboard; Accents After Letter", you will type the accents after the character. 
	
	e.g.: α + ´ = ά

	With "Ancient Greek Keyboard; Accents Before Letter", you will type the accents before the character. 
	
	e.g.: ´ + α = ά

	With "Ancient Greek Keyboard; Beta Code Version", you will type as with the Greek Beta Code. 
	
	e.g.: α + / = ά

## 3: Activate
It will start disabled, and you can activate or deactivate it at any time with Ctrl + Alt + G

>it is safe to leave running in the background, and the code can be seen in the [Source Files](https://github.com/Ithemule/Ancient-Greek-Polytonic-Keyboard/tree/main/Source%20Files) folder

>The program ([autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/)) can \*only\* be used with Windows.

## 4: Auto-Start (Optional)
If you want to set the keyboard to start with windows:
1. Press Windows+R to open the “Run” dialog box.
2. Type “shell:startup” and then hit Enter to open the “Startup” folder.
3. Create a shortcut in the “Startup” folder to any file, folder, or app's executable file. It will open on startup the next time you boot.

## 5: Editing (Optional and Difficult)
*Only* if you want to edit the keyboard, you will have to download and install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), make any edits on the .ahk file of your choice (change the appropriate .txt file to .ahk), then right-click it and click Compile Script

- To make edits, I recommend using CTRL + H to find any replace ONLY the input key you want to change, 
 - e.g. Find ` ? `, Replace with ` ; `, do **not** check Match Case
   - n.b. if you set any inputs to h, you will run into difficulties typing `χ` or `φ`, 
    - if you're replacing `η`'s input, find and replace `!e`
